      <h2>Data Sources and Accuracy</h2>
      <p>
        This is a community-built app. Schedules and real-time indicators depend
        on the underlying transit feeds, which can occasionally be delayed or
        incomplete.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you see something that looks wrong (missing trip, incorrect delay badge,
        and similar issues), email support with:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>station pair (from -&gt; to)</li>
        <li>the trip time you expected</li>
        <li>a screenshot (if possible)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Common Questions</h2>
      <h3>Is this the official SMART app?</h3>
      <p>
        No. <strong>SMART trip is not affiliated with Sonoma-Marin Area Rail
        Transit (SMART).</strong> It is a community project.
      </p>

      <h3>Why does a trip not show a delay or cancellation?</h3>
      <p>
        Real-time info may not be available for every trip at all times. When
        the feed does not provide it, the app falls back to scheduled times.
      </p>

      <h3>I got an alert badge. Where do I read it?</h3>
      <p>
        Open the <strong>Service Alerts</strong> panel in the app to view unread
        alerts. Once viewed, the badge count updates.
      </p>

      <h3>Can you add a feature?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. Email a short request. If it is a bug or issue, include the
        details listed in the Contact Support section above.
